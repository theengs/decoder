Theengs Decoder project aims to provide an efficient, portable and lightweight library for Internet of Things decoding.
Sensors and devices use chains of data to communicate to gateways, computers, servers. Enabling to have lightweight and fast communication, on the other hand we have a huge diversity of communication methods, resulting in the sensors or devices to be closed to one ecosystem or a few.
Theengs decoder is a library that gather things decoders and operate them so as to understand these things on a common format. This format can easily be integrated into different systems, these systems will be open thanks to the capabilities offered by the Theengs Decoder.

Theengs Decoder leverages json format to receive data and provide an enriched output.
It's also a simplified way of defining the thing properties and how to decode these.

Theengs Decoder can be used on memory constraint environment like micro controllers (ESP32, ESP8266, Arduino), on PC or on a Unix server.
It is setup with unit testing so as to assure that the modification done on the library doesn't affect previous capabilities.

In a few words:
* Light
* Portable
* Expandable
* Interoperable
